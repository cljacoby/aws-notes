# IAM

## Identity Access Management 101

### What is IAM
* IAM allows managing users level of access in the AWS consol
* Grants permission to different aspects of AWS
* Granular permission control
* Identity Federation supporting Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
* Requires MFA
* Provides temporary access to services when neccessary
* Allows setting password rotation timeframe
* Supports PCI DSS Compliance
* **IAM is incredibly important, as it defines the rules by which all other AWS resources will interact/operate**

### Terminology

#### 1. Users
* End users such as people, employees of a company, etc.

#### 2. Groups
* Groups of people. Each user in group inherits permission in group.

#### 1. Policies
* Policies are made up of documents called Policy Documents. These docuemntsare in JSON format and defined what a User/Group/Role is able to do

#### 1. Roles
* A role describes ways different resources in AWS may interact with each other.
* For example, a role might specify that an EC2 isntance is privelaged to right to an S3 bucket1

### Summary of IAM Lab
* IAM is universal, and not specific to a region (at this time)
* The root account is the account created when you create your AWS account, and it has complete Admin access
* New users by default have **NO** permissions when first created
* New users are assigned an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for programatic access to AWS
* Programmatic and Console (UI) access are different, and are enabled for a user independantly
* Access Key ID and Secret Access Key **ONLY** allow programmatic access, not console accesss
* Your Access Key ID and Secrey Access Key will only be visible once, so save the CSV file of the keys somewhere secure
* Use MFA to protect access to the root account. MFA uses Google Authenticator app
* Can customize password rules (such as minimum length and inclusion of special characters) and rotation timefram

### Summary of Creating a Billing Alarm Lab
* Ryan creates a 10 dollar billing alarm that sends email notification

### IAM Exam Review
* IAM consists of the following:
  * User
    * Users are the individual end users of the AWS resources
    * Organized into Groups
  * Group
    * Groups of Users
    * Organizations of users with different permission settings
  * Roles
    * Define access of AWS resrouces to other AWS resoures
    * For example, the ability of an EC2 to read/write to S3
    * This might be named an 'S3-Admin' role
  * Policies
    * Policies define the permissions that make up Users, Groups, and Roles
    * Are individual JSON files that define an indidual permission
    * Can use wildcards to grant general/wide access when needed
    * Policies are explored more in the *Certified Security Speciality* AWS Certificatio
* IAM is universal, not regional
* The "root account", which is created when the account is created, has full Admin access across the AWS console
* New users by defaule have **NO** permissions, anc can therefore do nothing
* New users by default will have an Access Key ID and Access Secret Key created for their account by default
* Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are only visible once, so make sure to save
* IAM allows defining password strength rules, and password rotation policy rules
