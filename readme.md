# IAM

## Identity Access Management 101

### What is IAM
* IAM allows managing users level of access in the AWS consol
* Grants permission to different aspects of AWS
* Granular permission control
* Identity Federation supporting Active Directory, Facebook, LinkedIn, etc.
* Requires MFA
* Provides temporary access to services when neccessary
* Allows setting password rotation timeframe
* Supports PCI DSS Compliance
* **IAM is incredibly important, as it defines the rules by which all other AWS resources will interact/operate**

### Terminology

#### 1. Users
* End users such as people, employees of a company, etc.

#### 2. Groups
* Groups of people. Each user in group inherits permission in group.

#### 1. Policies
* Policies are made up of documents called Policy Documents. These docuemntsare in JSON format and defined what a User/Group/Role is able to do

#### 1. Roles
* A role describes ways different resources in AWS may interact with each other.
* For example, a role might specify that an EC2 isntance is privelaged to right to an S3 bucket1

### Summary of IAM Lab
* IAM is universal, and not specific to a region (at this time)
* The root account is the account created when you create your AWS account, and it has complete Admin access
* New users by default have **NO** permissions when first created
* New users are assigned an Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for programatic access to AWS
* Programmatic and Console (UI) access are different, and are enabled for a user independantly
* Access Key ID and Secret Access Key **ONLY** allow programmatic access, not console accesss
* Your Access Key ID and Secrey Access Key will only be visible once, so save the CSV file of the keys somewhere secure
* Use MFA to protect access to the root account. MFA uses Google Authenticator app
* Can customize password rules (such as minimum length and inclusion of special characters) and rotation timefram

### Summary of Creating a Billing Alarm Lab
* Ryan creates a 10 dollar billing alarm that sends email notification

### IAM Exam Review
* IAM consists of the following:
  * User
    * Users are the individual end users of the AWS resources
    * Organized into Groups
  * Group
    * Groups of Users
    * Organizations of users with different permission settings
  * Roles
    * Define access of AWS resrouces to other AWS resoures
    * For example, the ability of an EC2 to read/write to S3
    * This might be named an 'S3-Admin' role
  * Policies
    * Policies define the permissions that make up Users, Groups, and Roles
    * Are individual JSON files that define an indidual permission
    * Can use wildcards to grant general/wide access when needed
    * Policies are explored more in the *Certified Security Speciality* AWS Certificatio
* IAM is universal, not regional
* The "root account", which is created when the account is created, has full Admin access across the AWS console
* New users by defaule have **NO** permissions, anc can therefore do nothing
* New users by default will have an Access Key ID and Access Secret Key created for their account by default
* Access Key ID and Secret Access Key are only visible once, so make sure to save
* IAM allows defining password strength rules, and password rotation policy rules

# S3

## S3 101

### What is S3
* Simple Storage Service
* Provides developers securable, durable, 1highly scalable, object storage
* Simply put, a way to store files
* Able to store any size files, and accessable anywhere on the web

### S3 Basics
* Allows you to upload files
* Files may be between 0 Bytes and 5 TB
* AWS charges by the GB for file uploads
* S3 is organized into "buckets", which are interactable like directories on a file system
* Individual files are stored inside a bucket
* S3 is a universal namespace, so must be universally unique
* Example bucket URL:
  * `https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/acloudguru`
  * `acloudguru` is the bucket name
  * `s3-eu-west-1` is the regio
* Uploading a file to a bucket returns an HTTP 200 response status on succesful ulpload

### Data Consistency Model for S3
* Read after write consistency for PUTS of new objects
* Eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELTES (can take some time to propogate)
* Basically, after writing a new file (a.k.a. a new upload), the file will be immediately readable and its state will be accurate
* In contrast, if reading a file after a PUT or DELETE which modified an existing file, the file's state upon reading may or may not reflect the new changes
* Eventually, the modification will become consistent and reflect the changes
* acloudguru says after about a minute, the data consistency of modified files will be accurate

### S3 is a Simple Key-Value Storage
* S3 is a object based, which means it works for storing files of all varieties, but is not capable of installing an operating system or database
* S3 stores files via a key-value storage
* The key is the file name, and the value is the actual file contents
* There is also a version ID and metadata attached to every stored files
* Metadata includes customizable tags
* There are also subresources in S3:
  * Access Control Limits control access of Users/Groups to certain files in a bucket
  * Torrents (not covered in detail in this course)

## S3 Availability
* S3 is built for 99% availability
* Amazon guarentees 99.9% availability in the Service Level Agreement
* Amazon garuentees 99.999999999% durability for S3 information, meaning this percentage of files uploaded to S3 will not be lost
* Tiered Storage is available
* There is Lifecycle Managemnt, which manages files between storage services depending on time
* There is file versioning and version control within S3
* There is encryption service for uploaded files
* Control is managed by Control Lists and Bucket Policies
* Bucket policies define access policies for the entire bucket, whereas Access Control Lists control access with respect to files

## S3 Tiered Storage
* **S3 Standard**
  * Provides 99.99% availability and 99.999999999% durability for files, and is stored reduntantly across multiple facilities
  * Designed to sustain loss of 2 concurrent facilities
* **S3 IA**
  * Infrequent Access
  * Intendee for data that is accessed less often, but requires rapid access when needed
  * Lower fee for storage than S3, but charged a retrieval fee
* **S3 One Zone - IA**
  * Lower cost version of normal IA, but is only stored in one Availability Zone
* **Glacier**
  * Cheapest storage option
  * Intended for data archiving
  * Available in Expedited, Stanard, and Bulk varieties
    * **Expediated** 
    * **Standard** 
    * **Bulk**
